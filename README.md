### About

It’s essentially just [Atom UI Dark](https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui) with a few small modifications that I made primarily for myself:

- Custom minimap viewport styles.
- Custom tree-view styles that work on the left-hand side or right-hand side (I like mine on the right).
- The editor pane and tabs float on the inside of the window, away from any edges, which I especially like in fullscreen mode.

It’s not going to be for everyone, and I intend to continue making changes over time, but if you like it I’d love you to use it.
